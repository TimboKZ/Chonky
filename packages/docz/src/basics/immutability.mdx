# Immutability

Chonky assumes that the objects and arrays you provide through `FileBrowser` props (or
any other props) are **immutable**. It is very important for your application to
guarantee immutability, otherwise Chonky components will not update correctly.

## What is immutability?

Immutability is a crucial concept in React performance optimizations, and is used in
many React libraries, such as Redux. If you're new to React, you should learn this
concept as soon as possible.

I will not go into the details of data immutability here. Instead, I'll point you to
some useful resources which you can study yourself:

-   [Dave Ceddia - Immutability in React and Redux: The Complete Guide](https://daveceddia.com/react-redux-immutability-guide/)
-   [Redux FAQ - Immutable Data](https://redux.js.org/faq/immutable-data)
-   [StackOverflow - Why should objects in Redux be immutable?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34958775/why-should-objects-in-redux-be-immutable/34962065#34962065)

## Example of a common mistake

Consider this example - you want to add a new file to the `files` array. The intuitive
way is to just `.push()` the new file. However, this will change the
array contents without updating array reference, which violates the principle of
immutability.

The correct approach would be to create a new array (and thus obtain a
new array reference), then copy over all elements from the old array, appending the
new file to the end of the array.

Here's the code illustrating the above example:

```ts
// Incorrect - mutating the array:
const oldArray1 = [1];
const newArray1 = oldArray1;
newArray1.push(2);
console.log(oldArray1 === newArray1); // prints `true`, React can't tell the difference

// Correct - creating new array:
const oldArray2 = [1];
const newArray2 = [...oldArray2, 2];
console.log(oldArray2 === newArray2); // prints `false`, React knows array changed
```
